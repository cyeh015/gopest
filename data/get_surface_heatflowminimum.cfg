# get_surface_heatflow.py
#
# This utility calculates the heatflow history through top surface of the model
# Total heatflows are calculated on the defined zones.  Zones can be specified 
# by lists of column names, as well as polygons that includes columns to be 
# added up.
#
# This "get_surface_heatflow.cfg" file should be placed in working directory

# <<< DO NOT MODIFY THIS SECTION >>> unless you know what you are doing.
# This is the listing file table's column names, used to lookup appropriate

# (GGG table) generation rate, enthalpy, (CCC table) heat flow, mass flow

[IncludeGENERs]
# Those wells (spring wells most of the time) specified here will be included 
# for the total heat flows.  Columns of these geners will be automatically
# determined.  It is possible to use wildcast character '*' to match a number 
# of geners.  eg. 'SP***' matches all geners like 'SP  1' and 'SPa99'.
 

[UserDefinedZones_ColumnNames]
# List the names of zones, each zone is then defined as a separate 
# entry.  eg. [UserDefinedZones_ColumnNames] has two entries: ZoneA and ZoneB, 
# then [ZoneA] is defined as a series of columns, [ZoneB] define another
# set of columns.  Column names supports the wildcast character '*'8 as well,
# in similar fashion to [IncludeGENERs]

[UserDefinedZones_Polygon]
# List the names of zones, each zone is then defined as a separate 
# entry.  eg. [UserDefinedZones_Polygon] has two entries: ZoneC and ZoneD, then 
# [ZoneC] is defined as a series of coordinates that forms a polygon that 
# circles around desired columns.  [ZoneD] defines another.
